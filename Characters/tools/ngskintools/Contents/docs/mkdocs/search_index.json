With instructions below, ngSkinTools module file (through which Maya locates ngSkinTools plugin and it's other important files) is created in current user's module dir (\nuser dir\n/maya/\nmaya version\n/modules\n); if you want ngSkinTools installation to be available for all users, you should move that file to \nmaya-home-folder\n/modules\n instead. \n\n\nWindows\n\n\nExecutable installer\n\n\nThis is your ordinary automated install. Files are extracted into your specified directory, and module discovery file placed into \nuser dir\n/maya/\nmaya version\n/modules\n folder. If you're installing newer plugin version, uninstalling previous one is not required, but recommended.\n\n\nManual install\n\n\n\n\nExtract archive somewhere you'll keep it, for example \nC:\\my-maya-plugins\\ngSkinTools\n.\n\n\n\n\nIf you have Python installed, running \ninstall.py\n should do the rest of the work.\n   Otherwise, manually copy file \nngSkinTools-module.txt\n to \nuser documents\n\\maya\\\nmaya version\n\\modules\n directory, where:\n\n\n\n\nuser documents\n is your windows user home folder (under WinXP that's \nC:\\Documents And Settings\\Username\\Documents\n and in Win7 that's \nC:\\Users\\Username\\My Documents\n)\n\n\n\n\nmaya version\n is the folder for your Maya version. If you've downloaded plugin for 2016 64bit Maya, folder will be named \n\"2016 x64\"\n.

It should be extracted as executable, if not - run that from shell as \"\npython ./install.py\n\" or \"\nchmod u+x ./install.py;install.py\n\".

This is not an in-depth guide nor a highlight of best features of plugin - instead, just some ngSkinTools workflow basics to get started with.\n\n\nIf you prefer video tutorial instead, \nthere's one available as well\n, covering pretty much the same thing.\n\n\nIt is assumed that the reader is already somewhat familiar with rigging and skinning essentials using standard Maya tools. \n\n\nGet your rig ready\n\n\n\n\nTo begin using ngSkinTools, you should already have a smooth-skin-bound mesh. Either open one of your existing rigs, or load up a new mesh and bind it to joints using smooth bind (\nSkin \n Bind Skin \n Smooth Bind\n).\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nYou might have other deformers in deformation chain after skin cluster - for example, poly smooth node; if any of them change vertex order in the mesh, turn those off.\n\n\n\n\nInitialize skinning layers\n\n\nSelect your mesh and open ngSkinTools (a button in ngSkinTools shelf).\n\n\nMost of the UI will be disabled as plugin needs some more additional setup to be done before you can use all the features of ngSkinTools on your mesh. Select the mesh you want to skin, an you should see something similar to this:\n\n\n\n\nThis shows the discovered mesh shape from your selection, and skin cluster that is attached to it. Click \"Initialize Skinning Layers\" button.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nFor the curious, this attaches a temporary node in the scene that will store skinning layers information for the selected skin cluster. \n\n\n\n\nThe UI changes to this:\n\n\n\n\nThe list on the left is layers. This is where you select active layer, and can also add/remove/arrange them. After initializing ngSkinTools layers for the first time, a single layer will be created, which has all the original weights on the skin cluster. \n\n\nOn the right influences (joints) are being listed. This list is used to select influence to paint weights for, or a group of influences for some other operation.\n\n\nStart painting weights\n\n\nPainting is  similar to how it is done with \nPaint Skin Weights Tool\n in Maya. Click \nPaint\n button at the bottom of \nPaint\n tab to start the paint tool.\n\n\n\n\nNow, select a layer in layer list, an influence in influences list, and, using one of the paint tools (Replace, Add, Scale or Smooth) start editing weights. Paint settings are somewhat identical to what they are in standard \nPaint Skin Weights Tool\n, but you'll notice a few differences:\n\n\n\n\nBrush intensity is saved and restored separately for each paint mode. It makes more sense that for \nScale\n you would usually use a large value, something like \n.9\n, while \nAdd\n better works with small increments, like \n.1\n.\n\n\nSmoothing brush operates operates on all influences in a vertex. You should notice a very intuitive response from the brush.\n\n\n\n\nSee \nPaint Tab\n if you need more assistance in understanding this UI.\n\n\nAdd more layers\n\n\nSkinning layers is a very powerful tool. Just like in your favorite image editing application, layers will allow you to paint in multiple \"planes\". Paint spine weights in one layer, arms on the other, and ngSkinTools will combine this real-time into single weights \"image\" for skinCluster to use.\n\n\nAs we're just getting the first feel here, just create a few of them (right-click layers list and choose \nNew Layer\n), without worrying if you need them or not.\n\n\n\n\nNow, try experimenting. What happens if you flood all weights to \njoint1\n on the lower layer, and paint on some vertices  to the \njoint2\n in the upper layer? Not really impressive yet, \njoint2\n simply overrides \njoint1\n. \n\n\nThe real magic happens when you go back to lower layer, and add some weights for \njoint3\n. Weights will be shared between \njoint1\n and \njoint3\n, but then previously painted \njoint2\n will override areas where it's painted.\n\n\nNow try doing something more practical. In lowest layer, flood everything to just spine joints. In higher layer, paint just shoulders. Add few more layers for arms, hips, legs, props.. Before you do though, have a quick look at \ncontrolling layer transparency\n.\n\n\nMirror weights\n\n\nMirroring is a bit different in ngSkinTools. The process is divided into two parts: \n\n\n\n\nInitializing mirror info\n: this is where plugin memorizes how vertices and influences on one side map to the other side. You only have to do this once, unless you add more influences later;\n\n\nMirroring weights\n: because plugin already knows how to find left and right side, you can repeat this as many times as you want in any pose.     \n\n\n\n\nTo initialize mirror info, put your rig into neutral position, go to \nMirror\n tab and click \nInitialize\n. In the dialog that opens, click \nInitialize\n to accept default options.\nTo begin using mirror function (via \nMirror\n button in \nPaint\n tab, or from the \nMirror\n tab), you have to initialize mirror information first. \n\n\n\n\nPut your rig into neutral position, go to \nMirror\n tab and click \nInitialize\n. In the dialog that opens, click \nInitialize\n to accept default options.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nEven though default options might work for basic rigs, there are quite a few features for controlling mirror behavior in \nInitialize Mirror\n window. See \nMirror Tab\n for details.\n\n\n\n\nMirror is now enabled for the mesh.

When you paint, mirror, or perform any other weight setting operation, it targets currently selected layer. Some operations (like mirror) support multiple selected layers; use shift-select or ctrl-select to select multiple items in the list.\n\n\nLayers can be added, edited and removed here using the context menu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Layer...\n - opens up a dialog for a new layer to be created. Enter the name \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuplicate Selected Layer(s)\n - makes a copy of selected layer; command supports multiple selected layers;\n\n\n\n\nDelete Selected Layer(s)\n - selected layer is removed from layers list; command supports multiple selected layers;\n\n\nMerge Layer Down\n - selected layer gets merged with the layer underneath it.\n\n\nMove Current Layer Up\n, \nMove Current Layer Down\n: change the order of layer list. Layer order is important because upper layers override contents of lower layers;\n\n\nToggle Layer On/Off\n - enable/disable layer. Weights that were painted in disabled layers do not get added to the skin cluster.\n\n\n\n\nProperties...\n - adjust properties of the selected layer.\n\n\n\n\nLayer opacity is one of the ways to control \ntransparency\n in a layer; value \n1.0\n means that layer is 100% enabled, while \n0.0\n effectively turns layer off (0%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInfluences list\n\n\nThis list shows skin influences (joints) of currently selected mesh. Selected item in the list is an \nactive influence\n, being a target for operations like paint, copy/paste, etc. Some operations support multiple selected influences, in that case, use ctrl-select (or shift-select) to select multiple items.\n\n\nThe list also contains a special item to select \nlayer mask\n, and, if skinCluster \"Skinning Method\" is set to \"Weight Blended\", there's also an item to edit dual quaternion blend weights:\n\n\n\n\nTo make finding influences easier, use \nInfluence Filter\n to list only those you currently need.\n\n\nUse context menu for more operations: \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopy Influence Weights\n: for currently selected influence, copies values across all vertices into memory to be later used for \nPaste Weights\n operation.\n\n\nCut Influence Weights\n: same as \"Copy\", but sets influences to 0.0 after;\n\n\nPaste Weights (Add)\n: using weights previously stored in memory via \nCut/Copy Influence Weights\n operation, merge them into the current influence;\n\n\nPaste Weights (Replace)\n: active influence values are replaced with weights previously stored in memory via \nCut/Copy Influence Weights\n, discarding previous weights on the influence;\n\n\nList All Influences\n: when this option is selected, Influences List shows all influences (unless further filtered by \nInfluences Filter\n);\n\n\nList Only Active Influences\n: when this option is selected, only those influences will be shown that have weights painted on currently active layer. This is a convenient option when you've got your layers painted and now jumping between them tweaking weights here and there - as you switch from layer to layer, you only see influences relevant to this selected layer. Obviously, if you want to add an influence to the layer, you'll have to switch back to \nList All Influences\n;\n\n\nConvert Mask to Transparency\n: multiplies layer weights with mask value, and discards the mask; as a result, layer will behave the same (final transparency untouched), but it will no longer be provided by mask;\n\n\nConvert Transparency to Mask\n: converts all layer transparency to mask value, and upscales weights on all vertices to a sum of 1.0; this mode is useful when you started painting your layer without mask, but now want to convert to mask workflow; \n\n\nShow/Hide Influence Filter\n: toggles visibility of \nInfluences Filter\n.\n\n\n\n\nInfluences filter\n\n\n\n\nTo narrow down the number of influences shown, enter a hint in \nInfluence Filter:\n search box. You don't need to specify influence name precisely - try entering a fragment of what you're searching for, then refine the query when you get the results. Only influences matching the filter will be shown.\n\n\nSome filter examples:\n\n\n\n\nL_\n will match influences \"L_shoulder_joint, L_arm, jnt_l_finger1\" - basically anything that contains string \nL_\n in it's name. It's also case-insensitive;\n\n\nL_ R_\n will match \"L_arm, R_arm\" influences; when search terms are separated by space, this basically means \n\"show anything that matches \nL_\n, as well as anything that matches \nR_\n\"\n;\n\n\nL_*arm\n will match \"L_upper_arm\", \"L_lower_arm_twist\"; use placeholder \n*\n when you want to specify that influence name needs to match two fragments, with \"anything in between\" as \n*\n;\n\n\nCombine queries as you see fit, like \nL_*arm*twist R_*arm*twist shoulder\n to limit the list to just arm and shoulders (query will probably differ based on your naming scheme).\n\n\n\n\nShow all influences / Only influences with non-zero weights\n correspond to \nall / active influences\n in Influences list context menu, so it's just an alternate UI for the same feature.\n\n\nPaint tab\n\n\nPaint tab provides configuration to paint weights tool. It does not start internal Maya's default \nPaint Skin Weights Tool\n, as ngSkinTools has it's own implementation.\n\n\nThe UI will be disabled while the tool is not active; start the paint tool by clicking \nPaint\n button at the lower right corner (\nPaint\n button is replaced by \nFlood\n while paint tool is active);\n\n\n\n\nPaint tool will always target last selected layer and influence, so select those in Layers/Influences list first.\n\n\nTool settings should be familiar for Maya users already:\n\n\n\n\nBrush shape\n: changes the shape of the brush as well as it's opacity on the edges. \n\n\nMode\n: changes brush behavior; see \nPaint Modes\n;\n\n\nIntensity\n: Overall intensity of the brush. For the convenience, this setting is saved per brush mode, and restored as you switch between them.\n\n\nBrush Radius\n: while you can use this field to set brush radius, it's much more convenient to do it interactively: as everywhere else in Maya, hold \"B\" button and left-drag with the mouse to grow/shrink it.\n\n\n\n\nTab buttons:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPaint\n: Start the paint tool. Switches the mesh to weights preview mode, and you can start painting the values:\n\n\n\n\nYou don't need to exit the tool to switch active layer or influence. Just select them in the Layers/Influences list and continue painting. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlood\n: apply current paint operation to the whole selection. It's almost equivalent as if you'd spend the time to paint with current brush across the whole mesh/vertex selection.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThis feature is mostly useful when applying some smoothiness across the whole layer. Select \nSmooth\n mode, set \nintensity\n to a lower value, and hit \nFlood\n few times until you're satisfied with results. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMirror\n: a shortcut to mirror operation, available in \nMirror tab\n. This will not be available until mirroring info is initialized, so visit Mirror tab to start using it.        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPaint modes:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplace\n: sets weight for an influence to specified value; when reducing weight, remainder is distributed to other influences in the layer; if there are no other influences in the layer, layer transparency is created instead.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nuse CTRL key to invert intensity value. Intensity 1.0 becomes 0.0, 0.9 becomes 0.1, etc. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nuse SHIFT key to switch to Smooth mode while painting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd\n: appends value to the current weight of an influence. Use this mode with low intensity values (e.g. 0.1) to slightly increase influence weights over the paint area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScale\n: multiplies current weight of an influence with intensity value. Use this mode to reduce influence weights over paint area when using high intensity values, like 0.9 or other values close to 1.0.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmooth\n: smooth weights in a paint area. This tool affects all influences, unless layer mask is selected. Weights are averaged slightly and deformation appears smoother.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMirror tab\n\n\nThis is where options for mirroring can be adjusted.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThis is just a UI reference. For mirroring workflow, see \nmirroring\n section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMirror direction\n: Choose the direction of the mirror: copy right-side contents on to the left side, or vice versa?\n\n\n\n\nGuess from stroke\n: tries to guess mirror direction based on last brush stroke you did. If most of your paint stroke was done on the left-hand-side of the character, it will behave like \"Left to right\" selection, and vice versa;\n\n\nLeft to right (+X to -X)\n: will mirror weights of vertices that are on the positive side of X axis on to the verts on the negative side;\n\n\nRight to left (-X to +X)\n  will mirror weights of vertices that are on the negative side of X axis on to the verts on the positive side;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nDepending on mirror axis you selected, options might be named slightly differently (\n\"top to bottom\"\n, \n\"front to back\"\n); when in doubt, refer to axis direction: \n\"+Y to -Y\"\n, etc;\n\n\n\n\nMirror seam width\n: defines seam width (in scene distance units) between two sides; this allows for some automatic smoothing on vertices that are near mirror axis. Start with a small value, which basically results in sharp mirroring edge (as it is in standard Maya tools), and experiment with increasing it, which will make mirror operation have a falloff on the mirro seam.\n\n\nSee \nMirror Seam\n to understand how this works.\n\n\nTab buttons:\n\n\nInitialize\n: opens \nInit Weights Mirror\n dialog.\n\n\nMirror Weights\n: mirrors weights on selected layer(s) with the settings above.   \n\n\nInit Weights Mirror\n\n\n\n\nRelax tab",

The list also contains a special item to select  layer mask , and, if skinCluster \"Skinning Method\" is set to \"Weight Blended\", there's also an item to edit dual quaternion blend weights:   To make finding influences easier, use  Influence Filter  to list only those you currently need.  Use context menu for more operations:     Copy Influence Weights : for currently selected influence, copies values across all vertices into memory to be later used for  Paste Weights  operation.  Cut Influence Weights : same as \"Copy\", but sets influences to 0.0 after;  Paste Weights (Add) : using weights previously stored in memory via  Cut/Copy Influence Weights  operation, merge them into the current influence;  Paste Weights (Replace) : active influence values are replaced with weights previously stored in memory via  Cut/Copy Influence Weights , discarding previous weights on the influence;  List All Influences : when this option is selected, Influences List shows all influences (unless further filtered by  Influences Filter );  List Only Active Influences : when this option is selected, only those influences will be shown that have weights painted on currently active layer. This is a convenient option when you've got your layers painted and now jumping between them tweaking weights here and there - as you switch from layer to layer, you only see influences relevant to this selected layer. Obviously, if you want to add an influence to the layer, you'll have to switch back to  List All Influences ;  Convert Mask to Transparency : multiplies layer weights with mask value, and discards the mask; as a result, layer will behave the same (final transparency untouched), but it will no longer be provided by mask;  Convert Transparency to Mask : converts all layer transparency to mask value, and upscales weights on all vertices to a sum of 1.0; this mode is useful when you started painting your layer without mask, but now want to convert to mask workflow;   Show/Hide Influence Filter : toggles visibility of  Influences Filter .",

Tool settings should be familiar for Maya users already:   Brush shape : changes the shape of the brush as well as it's opacity on the edges.   Mode : changes brush behavior; see  Paint Modes ;  Intensity : Overall intensity of the brush. For the convenience, this setting is saved per brush mode, and restored as you switch between them.  Brush Radius : while you can use this field to set brush radius, it's much more convenient to do it interactively: as everywhere else in Maya, hold \"B\" button and left-drag with the mouse to grow/shrink it.   Tab buttons:    Paint : Start the paint tool. Switches the mesh to weights preview mode, and you can start painting the values:   You don't need to exit the tool to switch active layer or influence. Just select them in the Layers/Influences list and continue painting.     Flood : apply current paint operation to the whole selection. It's almost equivalent as if you'd spend the time to paint with current brush across the whole mesh/vertex selection.   Note  This feature is mostly useful when applying some smoothiness across the whole layer. Select  Smooth  mode, set  intensity  to a lower value, and hit  Flood  few times until you're satisfied with results.      Mirror : a shortcut to mirror operation, available in  Mirror tab .

Add : appends value to the current weight of an influence. Use this mode with low intensity values (e.g. 0.1) to slightly increase influence weights over the paint area.    Scale : multiplies current weight of an influence with intensity value. Use this mode to reduce influence weights over paint area when using high intensity values, like 0.9 or other values close to 1.0.    Smooth : smooth weights in a paint area.

Guess from stroke : tries to guess mirror direction based on last brush stroke you did. If most of your paint stroke was done on the left-hand-side of the character, it will behave like \"Left to right\" selection, and vice versa;  Left to right (+X to -X) : will mirror weights of vertices that are on the positive side of X axis on to the verts on the negative side;  Right to left (-X to +X)   will mirror weights of vertices that are on the negative side of X axis on to the verts on the positive side;    Note  Depending on mirror axis you selected, options might be named slightly differently ( \"top to bottom\" ,  \"front to back\" ); when in doubt, refer to axis direction:  \"+Y to -Y\" , etc;   Mirror seam width : defines seam width (in scene distance units) between two sides; this allows for some automatic smoothing on vertices that are near mirror axis.
